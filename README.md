# Leibnitz-Aprox-App
This app approximates the value of Pi using the Leibniz formula. The user can input the number of iterations to be performed, which affects the accuracy of the approximation. The app displays the result of the approximation in decimal format, along with the relative difference from the actual value of Pi in parts per thousand.
